### WHY?

I can waste a lot of time exploring the cool election maps developed by news organizations like the Washington Post and the New York Times. But my favorite is FiveThirtyEight's. 

I thought it would be a fun challenge to make a retro version of their map. Could I find a way to render the map in an 80x24 ANSI BBS terminal window? 

Yes, I did. You can see it in action by visiting my BBS: telnet://guardian.synchro.net.

Use the arrow keys to move around the map and see the presidential candidates' chance of winning each state, as calculated by FiveThirtyEight.com.

The final screen shows the "How the forecast has changed" graph.
